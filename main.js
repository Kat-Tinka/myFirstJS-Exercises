Exercise 2
Create a variable called age with a number that is your age. 
Do not use string quotes for numbers.
Add a line to print that variable in the console. 
Save the file and reload the page. You should see your name and your age


/*
this works, but its not allowed in this task to use string quotes for numbers.

console.log(age);

/*
Exercise 3
Create a variable called juliaAge with a value 32. 
Create another variable called ageDiff and 
set it to an expression that calculates your age minus Julias's age. 
Print the value of ageDiff. 
Save the file and reload the page. 
You should see your age and the age difference. 
If you are younger than Julia, you should see a negative number.

Writing code with conditionals
Conditionals are forms used programming to tell the computer to do different things, 
depending on some test, e.g., "if the user is logged in, say "Hi" else say "Please log in."

The most basic conditional form is if...then...else...

Exercise 4
Write a conditional that compares the variable with your age with the number 21. 
It should print either "You are older than 21" or "You are not older than 21", 
appropriately, depending on your age. 
Save your JavaScript file and reload the page. 
Make sure you see the correct message. 
Try changing your age in the JavaScript file 
to make sure the other message prints when it should.
*/
/*if (age>21) {console.log("You are older than 21")
    
} else {
   console.log("You are not older than 21")
}

// let age be 77
if (age>77) {console.log("You are older than 21")
    
} else {
   console.log("You are not older than 21")
}
*/

/*
Exercise 5
Write a conditional that compares your age with Julia's age. 
This conditional will need to test if you are older, younger, 
or the same age, 
and print, appropriately, either "Julia is older than you", 
Julia is younger than you", 
or "You have the same age as Julia".

Save your changes and reload the file.

if (age>julliaAge) {
    console.log("Julia is younger than you");
} else if (age == julliaAge) {
    console.log("You have the same age as Julia");
} else if (age < julliaAge) {
    console.log("Julia is older than you");

JavaScript Array
Sorting an Array
Exercise 1
Create an array with all the names of your class 
(including mentors). 
Sort the array alphabetically. 
Then print the first element of the array in the console. 
On the next line, 
print the last element of the array in the console. 
On the next line, print all the elements of the array in the console 
(use a "for" loop). 
Save the file and reload the page. 
You should see the first element of the sorted array, 
the last element of the sorted array, 
and a list of all the elements in order 
in the array in the console.
